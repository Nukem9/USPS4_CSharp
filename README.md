# USPS4_CSharp

C# port of the USPS4 ([Intelligent MailÂ® Barcode Multi-Platform Encoding Software](https://ribbs.usps.gov/index.cfm?page=intellmailmailpieces)) encoder.

This requires the 32-bit or 64-bit `usps4cb.dll` file from [https://ribbs.usps.gov/onecodesolution/download.cfm](https://ribbs.usps.gov/onecodesolution/download.cfm?downloads=Windows&selection=4). It must be renamed with the architecture (`usps4cb32.dll` and/or `usps4cb64.dll`).
